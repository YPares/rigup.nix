## Instructions For AI Agents

**Read the authoritative documentation in:** `riglets/agent-rig/SKILL.md`

`agent-rig` contains complete documentation about:
- What _riglets_ and _rigs_ are
- How to use them
- How to create new riglets
- The rig architecture and design

See `riglets/agent-rig/default.nix` for how this `SKILL.md` itself is turned into a full-fledged riglet.
